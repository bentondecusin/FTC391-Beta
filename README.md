## Greeting
Greeting from Benton '19. 

## Downloading the Project
Download it and unzip it. Open Android Studio and import this folder. It takes a while. Don't get panic. After that, see that hammer? Click it and it will build the app. Connect the RC phone (Not the DS Phone) to your device. Click the triangle and build the app on the RC phone. Then you are good to go

## BTW
Configure the robot based on the codes related to motor configuration before you run the robot.
If you are not sure about robot configuration, this link would be helpful https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/wiki/Configuring-Your-Hardware
